# generated-text-file
A repo used to test out stuff

generated.py is a script to create txt file with specific size. Used to test size cap in web dev

Manual:

change target size in TARGET_MB: example TARGET_MB = 5.0 means a 5 mb text file

change character in the generated chunk in CHARACTER : example CHARACTER = 'A' generated a string of A until target is met

to run use terminal of your choice and use: "python generated.py"

text file will be in the same directory
